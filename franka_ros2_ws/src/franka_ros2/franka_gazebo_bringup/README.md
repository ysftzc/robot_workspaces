# Franka Gazebo

**==Important Note:==**

Minimum necessary `franka_description` version is 0.3.0.
You can clone franka_description package from https://github.com/frankarobotics/franka_description.

A project integrating Franka ROS 2 with the Gazebo simulator.

## Launch RVIZ + Gazebo

Launch an example which spawns RVIZ and Gazebo showing the robot:

```bash
ros2 launch franka_gazebo_bringup visualize_franka_robot.launch.py
```

If you want to display another robot, you can define the robot_type:

```bash
ros2 launch franka_gazebo_bringup visualize_franka_robot.launch.py robot_type:=fp3
```

If you want to start the simulation including the franka_hand:

```bash
ros2 launch franka_gazebo_bringup visualize_franka_robot.launch.py load_gripper:=true franka_hand:='franka_hand'
```


## Joint Velocity Control Example with Gazebo

Before starting, be sure to build `franka_example_controllers` and `franka_description` packages.
`franka_description` must have the minimum version of 0.3.0.

```bash
colcon build --packages-select franka_example_controllers
```

Now you can launch the velocity example with Gazebo simulator.

```bash
ros2 launch franka_gazebo_bringup gazebo_joint_velocity_controller_example.launch.py load_gripper:=true franka_hand:='franka_hand'
```

Keep in mind that the gripper joint has a bug with the joint velocity controller.
If you are interested in controlling the gripper please use joint position interface.


## Joint Position Control Example with Gazebo

To run the joint position control example you need to have the required software listed in the joint velocity control section.

Then you can run with the following command.

```bash
ros2 launch franka_gazebo_bringup gazebo_joint_position_controller_example.launch.py load_gripper:=true franka_hand:='franka_hand'
```

## Joint Impedance Control Example with Gazebo

For running torque example. You must compile the `franka_ign_ros2_control` package located under `franka_gazebo_bringup`.
You can compile `franka_ign_ros2_control` with the following command.

```bash
colcon build --packages-select franka_ign_ros2_control
```

Then source your workspace.

```bash
source install/setup.sh
```

Then you can run the impedance control example.

```bash
ros2 launch franka_gazebo_bringup gazebo_joint_impedance_controller_example.launch.py load_gripper:=true franka_hand:='franka_hand'
```

## Mobile FR3 Duo Example with Gazebo

Before starting, be sure to build `franka_example_controllers`, `franka_gazebo_bringup`, `gz_ros2_control` and `franka_description` packages.

```bash
colcon build --packages-select franka_example_controllers franka_gazebo_bringup franka_description gz_ros2_control
source install/setup.bash
```

Now you can launch the mobile FR3 duo example with Gazebo:

```bash
ros2 launch franka_gazebo_bringup gazebo_mobile_fr3_duo_example.launch.py
```

To launch with the full sensor suite (4x cameras, 2x LiDARs, 1x IMU), also build `franka_mobile_sensors`:

```bash
colcon build --packages-select franka_mobile_sensors
source install/setup.bash
ros2 launch franka_gazebo_bringup gazebo_mobile_fr3_duo_example.launch.py with_sensors:=true
```

**Arguments:**
- `with_sensors`: If set to `true`, uses the sensor-enhanced description (`franka_mobile_sensors`) with Gazebo sensor plugins. Defaults to `false`.
- `world`: SDF world filename inside `franka_gazebo_bringup/worlds/` to load. Overrides the default world selection.

This will spawn the mobile base and two FR3 arms, and start the joint impedance controller for both arms and cartesian velocity control for the mobile base. RViz will also launch for visualization. Select `base_link` to see the robot there.

Note: On the real hardware, the mobile base only accepts cartesian velocity commands.

## Throubleshooting

If you experience that Gazebo can't find your model files, try to include the workspace. E.g.

```bash
export GZ_SIM_RESOURCE_PATH=${GZ_SIM_RESOURCE_PATH}:/workspaces/src/
```
